The 2-RCD code is able to solve huge structured convex  quadratic programs with a single linear equality constraints and box constraints  using the algorithm 2-RCD developed in the paper: I. Necoara, A. Patrascu, A random coordinate descent algorithm for optimization problems with composite objective function and linear coupled constraints, Computational Optim. & Applications, 57(2): 307-337, 2014.
